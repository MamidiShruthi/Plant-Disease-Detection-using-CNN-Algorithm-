# Plant-Disease-Detection-using-CNN-Algorithm-
This project aims to automatically detect plant diseases by analyzing leaf images using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The model is trained on a dataset containing healthy and diseased leaf images of various crops. It classifies the disease type to assist farmers and agricultural experts in early diagnosis.
